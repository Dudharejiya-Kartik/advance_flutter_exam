# Flutter Auction App

## Description

The Flutter Auction App is a comprehensive mobile application designed to facilitate auction management. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete auction products seamlessly. Users can easily add products to the auction, view their details, and manage their listings. The app integrates Firebase for secure cloud storage, ensuring that user data is safely stored and accessible from anywhere. Additionally, it utilizes SQLite for local data storage, providing offline access and enhancing performance. This combination of technologies ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, making it an ideal solution for auction enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Listing**: View, edit, and delete auction products.
- **Cloud Storage**: Securely store and retrieve auction data using Firebase.
- **Offline Access**: Utilize SQLite for local data storage, enabling users to access information even without an internet connection.
- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts and log in to manage their auction products.

## Animation

The app incorporates custom animations to enhance the user experience. For example, when there are no products available, the app displays a fade-in animation, making the interface feel more dynamic and engaging. This subtle use of animations helps draw users' attention and provides visual feedback during interactions, making the app more intuitive.
